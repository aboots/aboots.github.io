### Contributed to the Creation of Posts on Persian Medium and Development of a Persian Wikipedia Page for Test-driven Development

Contributed to the expansion of Test-Driven Development (TDD) knowledge, a software development approach that has revolutionized the way we write and test code. I have contributed to a blog post on Virgool, a Persian-language platform dedicated to technology knowledge sharing (similar to Medium). This platform has allowed me to reach a wide audience and engage in meaningful discussions about TDD. In addition, I have enriched the Persian Wikipedia page on TDD by adding comprehensive information and ensuring that the content is accurate and up-to-date with the help of a group of students. The pages can be accessed at the following links: [Virgool Post](https://virgool.io/@m_93656123/%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%87-%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%A2%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%88%D9%86-qr00jqcccdpj) and [TDD Wikipedia Page](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%87_%D8%A2%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%88%D9%86%E2%80%8C%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%B1).
